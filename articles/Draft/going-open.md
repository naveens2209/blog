Piracy on the internet is a big no no! You fall and fall as you are stung with the urge to once download a file against the wish of it's creators. After falling once you end up in a loop, continuing to do the same. Also software such as Windows by Microsoft is not going to get you far, let alone it's pirated copies. I am a strict non Proprietary code guy. If you didn't know that already, this blog is hosted on my GitHub.com repository, this is where all the superheroes of the computer world, revolutionaries with the urge to give their bit to the openness of the way we run the web congregate.

Coming back to my point, software such as MS office and Windows is not all that is shining, let alone gold. Within the years I have come to notice that the kind of care one has to keep of their PCs running these software is way more than waranted for something which is essentially paid for. Windows used to be my OS of choice when I was young, I would rather still wish to call it the 'only choice'(I didn't have any). But that has seized to be a point ever since the first GNU-linux liveCD came home. With linux you have to care less about maintainance, i.e. learn some terminal code, that is it.

Windows and Linux can be compared like two apples, one in a cage the other on the table. So why not learn something about Linux, say what?

## Why Linux, not another OS?
Linux is an Operating System similar to Mac OS, literally naming it GNU-Linux gives away too much. Here the abbr. GNU is GNU is Not Unix(recursive naming at it's best), that which Mac OS essentially is. GNU-Linux, if I may go into the history of it, was mainly a GNU shell(apps and the desktop environ you see on the display) running Unix Kernel, so Linux made it literally GNU.
